            Fish tank exists as a mean to provide an artificial habitat outside the sea for a variety of fish. After providing an artificial sustainable shelter for fish, people buy decorations to recreate the sea environment or to simply make inner side of fish take more visually pleasing. While owners may enjoy raising fish in a tank, I wondered if the surrounding environment for fish is enough.  However big the fish tank is, it will always be smaller than the size of where fish come from. What are possibilities to improve the environment of fish tank? In this project, multiple ways of improving fish tank to better enhance fish’s experience or stay will be explored.

          <p class="h6 mt-4"> 
            Both human-centered research approach and fish-centered research approach will be used to explore opportunities for improvement and better interaction experience between human and fish. Through iterative process and user(fish) testing, a final product will be developed to address such issues for goldfish.

              There are extensive research papers on marine animals and how home raised fish are prone to stress and malnutirition due to many environmental factors such as water quality problem and mental constraints.

              This concept demonstrates user’s capability of dividing the fish tank horizontally thus seperating fish in the upper half and other components of fish tank in the lower half. After this seperation, a valve attached to the fish tank will let the water of lower half out while still containing the water of upper half and having fish intact. This idea was met with physical challenges of such
              <br><br>
              - how well will water be contained at top?
              <br>
              - how accurately can we seperate fish?

          <p class="h6 mt-4">
              This concept demonstrates user’s capability to regularly clean out some wastes and dirt in fish tank by dropping a turbine product that would collect wastes floating in the fish tank. In the concept, this product is powered by water current in fish tank and fuction as filter unit. 
              <br><br>
              Robot fish to clean and filter to maintain water quality was considered for 2 seconds and disregarded.

          <p class="h6 mt-4">
              This concept demonstrates user’s capability to clean out the water with mininmized interference on fish. While cleaning the fish tank, having to move fish in a seperate bowl would cause fish a great amount of stress. This product aims to interupt the environment as little as possible to still scoop out the water at ease to promote more regular water changes by owners.

          <p class="h6 mt-4">
              This concept demonstrates user’s having to directly interact with products after the initial installation. Lifted base will provide a room for wastes to fall and opening valve will make it easier for owner to clean out the water. 
              <br><br>
              Technical issue is “is it possible for fish tank with a valve to hold the water pressure?”
