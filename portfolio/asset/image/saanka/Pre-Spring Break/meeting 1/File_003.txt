Interna Iona, context harries this....

Ethically dicey about whether people can afford to say no

The extent is that people would likely be able to keep the cheap smartphone they receive for this interaction

How to incentive people to us the app without being financially compensated 
And so that we don’t break these rules

The interactive dimension is ideal in this regard because it’s fun and interesting to share your stories of transportation with other people


Self-motivated timeline? 
What is the premise 
To be used for about a year or perhaps a shorter amount of time 
As long as possible, x number of months 

Try and set up with the hopes of it having a life of it’s own in order to not need so much intervention from Noah to get people to use the program/app

No need for exclusive ip ownership and should be some thing of an open source resource for other resources

//main points and problems

Came from thinking about ways not to rely entirely on Noah’s own observations from his perspective
Allows him to grab other perspectives and multiply ability to collect data but also allows people to document their own story and tell it in a particular way 

People are in control

 Perhaps have some sort of a feature that notices when they move and then prompts them to post at the end of the day! 


Almost all of the policy members and academics studying these are having the experience through their cars but is not the same thing that blue collar workers experience

Make those people’s stories more visible in a way that represents the everyday and not just the most extreme experiences that people have 

Hopefully these stories will have a platform and be able to influence the perspective of people using the app
