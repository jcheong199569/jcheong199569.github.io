                </h1>
                <h2>1. Customer submits a photo of himself/herself with a friend or a significant other to www.kolin.com</h2>

                <h2>2. When received, designer creates the outline of subjects.</h2>

                <h2>3. Customer will be contacted as the design is complete and will be give options of
                color, size, position of the design on either t-shirts or crewneck.</h2>

                <h2>4. Finished product will be delivered in next 5 business days after the completion of
                order.</h2>

                <h2>In the past several years, tattoo culture has become more familiar to public worldwide and nowadays, it seems af if the majority of population in its 20s have at least one ink on their body. Permenant art work on your body is carefully designed by customers themselves or by specific artists with their own unique style, thus yielding a lot more personal and sentimental values. One day, I questioned what if there is a similiar system in fashion industry that connects customers and designers to create art work on not on skin but on fabric.</h2>
